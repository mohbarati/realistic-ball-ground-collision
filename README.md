Center spring model is not very accurate as it doesn't model a normal ..say tennis ball (maybe it models something else?)

but Realistic ball-ground is a decent model (IMHO) for it considers a gas trapped inside the ball and provides the required pneumatic pressure to keep the ball spherical.  "# realistic-ball-ground-collision"
